![](doc/img/board.png)

Battleship (also known as Battleships or Sea Battle) is a strategy type guessing game for two players. 
You can find more info about the game on [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

In our case, `technological stacks` will fight with each other - for example spring vs akka. 
This is the reason this project was made - **to play with vary technological stacks in a fun way**.

## Preliminary assumptions

1. there is possible scenario to have 1 vs 10 battle
2. you can watch the game by coordinator web page
3. each player is containerized, so You can run whole battle on local or remote docker machine
